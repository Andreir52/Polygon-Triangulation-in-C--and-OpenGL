# Polygon-Triangulation-in-C++-and-OpenGL

This is a project for Computational Geometry that I made at University. This project consists of a program that triangulates any given polygon. The input vertices are drawn using the mouse in the OpenGL window. The polygon is triangulated in real time using the ear-cutting algorithm. First it selects an ear, removes it from the polygon and draws a line between the vertices of the ear. The process is repeated until the entire figure is triangulated.
